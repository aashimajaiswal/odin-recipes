    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p><em><strong>Parathas</strong></em> are the shallow-fried version of chapatis. 
    This recipes make crunchier and less-flaky parathas than those I buy from the store. 
    Serve with cinnamon-sugar for a sweet treat or with curries as a scooping bread.</p>

    <h2>Ingrdients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried mixed herbs</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix all-purpose flour and whole wheat flour in a bowl. 
        Sprinkle salt on top. Add butter, sugar, garlic powder, and dried herbs. 
        Mix together with your fingers. Pour water in gradually; 
        continue to mix by hand until a soft dough is formed.</li>
        <li>Knead dough until smooth and elastic, about 7 minutes. 
        Cover with a damp cloth; let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 8 equal portions. Shape into smooth balls; lightly flatten. 
        Dust with flour and roll into thin circles about 1/16-inch thick and 7 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Fry each dough circle until golden, 
        about 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.</li>
    </ol>
